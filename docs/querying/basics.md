## Gotchas

### Staleness

The timestamps at which to sample data, during a query, are selected
independently of the actual present time series data. This is mainly to support
cases like aggregation (`sum`, `avg`, and so on), where multiple aggregated
time series do not precisely align in time. Because of their independence,
Prometheus needs to assign a value at those timestamps for each relevant time
series. It does so by taking the newest sample that is less than the lookback period ago.
The lookback period is 5 minutes by default, but can be
[set with the `--query.lookback-delta` flag](../command-line/prometheus.md)

If a target scrape or rule evaluation no longer returns a sample for a time
series that was previously present, this time series will be marked as stale.
If a target is removed, the previously retrieved time series will be marked as
stale soon after removal.

If a query is evaluated at a sampling timestamp after a time series is marked
as stale, then no value is returned for that time series. If new samples are
subsequently ingested for that time series, they will be returned as expected.

A time series will go stale when it is no longer exported, or the target no
longer exists. Such time series will disappear from graphs
at the times of their latest collected sample, and they will not be returned
in queries after they are marked stale.

Some exporters, which put their own timestamps on samples, get a different behaviour:
series that stop being exported take the last value for (by default) 5 minutes before
disappearing. The `track_timestamps_staleness` setting can change this.

### Avoiding slow queries and overloads

If a query needs to operate on a substantial amount of data, graphing it might
time out or overload the server or browser. Thus, when constructing queries
over unknown data, always start building the query in the tabular view of
Prometheus's expression browser until the result set seems reasonable
(hundreds, not thousands, of time series at most).  Only when you have filtered
or aggregated your data sufficiently, switch to graph mode. If the expression
still takes too long to graph ad-hoc, pre-record it via a [recording
rule](../configuration/recording_rules.md#recording-rules).

This is especially relevant for Prometheus's query language, where a bare
metric name selector like `api_http_requests_total` could expand to thousands
of time series with different labels. Also, keep in mind that expressions that
aggregate over many time series will generate load on the server even if the
output is only a small number of time series. This is similar to how it would
be slow to sum all values of a column in a relational database, even if the
output value is only a single number.
